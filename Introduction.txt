Triliteral is a literate, polyglossal, esoteric, homoiconic, concatenative, Turing-complete, stack-oriented language inspired by Forth and the *triliteral root* construction common to Semitic languages.
Triliteral programs can be written in the Arabic, Hebrew or (with some loss of fidelity) Latin scripts, though only one at a time; the script used is determined by the file extension: .<.t><r><l>, .<tet><resh><lamed> or .trl.

A Triliteral program is a sequence of *words*, separated by whitespace and/or punctuation, where each word is derived from a three-consonant *root* designating a *stack*, modified by a four-vowel *stem* designating an *operation*.
The number of available consonants (and thus the number of stacks) depends on the script used, with Triliteral written in Arabic having 25 consonants available (and so 25^3 stacks), Hebrew 18 and Latin 21; in the Semitic scripts these are the letters other than the *matres lectrionis*, whereas in Latin they are the consonants proper and semi-vowels.
The matres lectrionis (full vowels in Latin) are <alif>, <alif maqsurah>, <waw> and <ya> in Arabic; <aleph>, <he>, <waw> and <yod> in Hebrew, and aeiou in Latin; however, for the purposes of forming stems, <alif> and <alif maqsurah> are considered equivalent, as are <aleph> and <he>, and e/i and o/u in Latin, while the short vowels (which may be designated - entirely optionally - by harakat in Arabic and niqqud in Hebrew, but must be omitted entirely in Latin) are considered together a fourth "vowel"; altogether each script has 4 vowels resulting in 4^4 = 256 possible stems.

For purposes of organization the vowels may be considered having the following digit values in a base-4 system: short vowels 0, <alif>/<alif maqsurah>/<aleph>/<he>/a 1, <waw>/<waw>/e/i 2, and <ya>/<yod>/o/u 3, with the *lowest* place value at the *start* of the word (the rightmost position in Arabic and Hebrew, the leftmost in Latin).
For example, the word *aktub* has root KTB and stem a_u_, 0301 in base 4 (49 in decimal, although this is not used much).
(Note that Triliteral written in the Latin script is case-insensitive, so this could also be written *Aktub*, *aKTuB* etc., with exactly the same meaning.)
Words also have a *numeric* value when used as the object of arithmetic operations, with that value determined (naturally) by *gematria*, adding together the values of the letters (in the common abjadi sequence in Arabic, the Mispar Gadol system in Hebrew, and the Golden Dawn system in Latin) to produce a single value; so, again, *aktub* designates the *number* 1+20+9+6+2 = 38.

As with any Forth, program execution begins with (every) stack empty and proceeds by reading one word at a time from the source file, parsing it (into root and stem), and executing it.
As a general rule, each word operates on the stack designated by its root according to the operation designated by its stem; however there are some important exceptions.
